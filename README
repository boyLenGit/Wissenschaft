CurveLab is a collection of Matlab and C++ programs to compute fast
discrete curvelet transform in two and three dimensions.

The 2d software includes the implementations of two algorithms: the
transform using wrapping and the one using unequally-spaced fast
fourier transform (USFFT).

The 3d software includes the in-core, out-core and MPI-based parallel
implementation of the 3d algorithm.

To install the package, see curvelab.pdf.
